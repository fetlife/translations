    faq:
      cc_a_part_1: We understand that it's a major inconvenience for many of you. But due to the number of content restrictions that come with accepting credit cards, the community as a whole has decided it's best for our long-term health and viability not to accept them.
      cc_a_part_2: If we wanted to accept credit cards we couldn't allow kinksters on FetLife to discuss watersports, hypnosis, period sex, blood play, edge play, consensual non-consent, and many other kinks commonly accepted by the kinky community.
      cc_a_part_3: As a community, we need a safe space for consenting adults to be able to be freely express themselves sexually. And if we accept credit cards or paypal, we would lose that freedom.
      cc_q: Q. Why doesn't FetLife accept Credit Cards or Paypal?
      gift_a: That’s super nice of you. Just visit their profile and click &ldquo;Gift Support&rdquo; link under &ldquo;Message Kinkster&rdquo; <i>#TheyWillLoveIt</i>
      gift_q: Q. Want to gift support to someone?
      month_a: Like Costco, we have to sell in bulk, to keep the monthly cost of supporting FetLife low!
